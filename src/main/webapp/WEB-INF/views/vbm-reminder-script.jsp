			1. Hello, may I speak with <b>${voterinformation.voterData.name}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. This is <b>${voterinformation.currentVolunteer.name}</b> calling on behalf of <b>${voterinformation.campaignName}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			3. We last reached out on <b>${voterinformation.lastCall}</b> and you indicated that you
			would be registering to vote by mail.  Have you had a chance to register
			to vote by mail?
		</p>
		<p>
			YES 4(a) That's great, remember to mail in your ballot by the date
			indicated on the form.  Is there any other information I can give you
			today?
		</p>
		<p>
			NO 4(b) No problem, this call was actually scheduled to remind you that
			you still have until <b>${voterinformation.regCutOffDay}</b> to register to vote by mail.
			Do you have any specific question I can answer to assist you in getting
			registered to vote by mail?

			casting your vote, making your voice heard, and being part of this
			historic election. Goodbye.
